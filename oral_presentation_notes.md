# Slides 

## slide 0. title 

> Temporal trend of the snow-related variables in Sierra Nevada in the last years: An analysis combining Earth Observation and hydrological modelling 

## slide 1. 
Climate change impacts on snow cover specially in Mediterranean mountain 

## slide 2. 
In this work we aim
* to analyze the the temporal trends of 
 * snow-cover related variables obtanied from satellite. 
 * precipitation data generated by detailed modelling (WiMMed)
* to explore the spatial pattern of the trends by:
 * elevation range, and 
 * hydrological basin 
* to explore the relationship between trends of snow-cover related indicators and precipitations trends 





# Slide 2
* Aims 
* Location of Sierra Nevada 

# Slide 3
> MODIS 

* We used 8-days MODIS snow cover product (MOD10A2) as the basis of this study. 
 * Spatial resolution 500 m 
 * Each MOD10A2 pixel is labelled as snow if it has had snow on one of the previous 8 days
 
* We have calculated several indicators from MOD10A2 images (Wang and Xie, 2009)
 * **Snow-cover duration (SCD)** is defined as the number of days covered by snow per hydrological year
 * **Snow-cover onset dates (SCOD)** is defined as the first date in the hydrological year that the pixel has snow. This indicator is useful to identify shifts in the starting of snow season.
 * **Snow-cover melting dates (SCMD)** is the last date in the hydrological year that the pixel has snow. This indicator provides useful information about the melting process.

> Snow-cover melting cycles (SCMC) is the number of melting cycles in each pixel per hydrological year.





# Slide 4 
> Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope estimation 

* Time span: 
 * Temporal trends of the indicators in a temporal range of 14 hydrological years.
 * hydrological year: 1 September of a calendar year to 31 August of the next calendar year 



# Slide 5: Results (I): General pattern of trend for Snow-cover related indicators
> General trend results for snow-cover indicators (scd, scod, scmd) 

* 80 % of the pixels covering Sierra Nevada showed a negative trend in snow cover duration 
* We also observed a positive trend in the snow-cover onset date for 68 % of the pixles. It means a delay in the snow-cover onset date. 
* We found an advance in the meltig date for more than 80 % of the pixels (negative trend in snow cover melting date)

# Slide 6: Results (II): Exploring the pattern of trends by hydrological basin



# Slide 7: Elevation pattern of the scd
