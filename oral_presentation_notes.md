# Slides 

## slide 0. title 

> Temporal trend of the snow-related variables in Sierra Nevada in the last years: An analysis combining Earth Observation and hydrological modelling 

## slide 1. 
Climate change impacts on snow cover specially in Mediterranean mountain 

## slide 2. 
In this work we aim
* to analyze the the temporal trends of 
 * snow-cover related variables obtanied from satellite. 
 * precipitation data generated by detailed modelling (WiMMed)
* to explore the spatial pattern of the trends by:
 * elevation range, and 
 * hydrological basin 
* to explore the relationship between trends of snow-cover related indicators and precipitations trends 





# Slide 2
* Aims 
* Location of Sierra Nevada 

# Slide 3
* MODIS and WiMMed methods

# Slide 4 
* Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope estimation 

# Slide 5: results 
* scd average and trend (map of both)
* scod + scmd --> table with % of total 

* 80 % of the pixels covering Sierra Nevada showed a negative trend in snow cover duration 
* We also observed a positive trend in the snow-cover onset date for 68 % of the pixles. It means a delay in the snow-cover onset date. 
* We found an advance in the meltig date for more than 80 % of the pixels (negative trend in snow cover melting date)

# Slide 6: explore snow indicators by basin? 

# Slide 7: Elevation pattern of the scd
