### Temporal trend of the snow-cover dynamics in Sierra Nevada in the last years: An analysis using satellite data and ecohydrological modelling data 




## Aims 

In this work ... 
We analysed the temporal trend of the snow cover dynamics in Sierra Nevada, a mediterranean Hihg-mountain located in the southern of Europe, from 2000 to 2014. 



An automated workflow was used to get snow cover related indicators. The worklfow processses all the images of the MODIS MOD10A2 product to generate indicators of the structure of the snow cover: snow-cover duration (scd), snow-cover onset dates (scod) and snow-cover melting dates (scmd) (`TODO`: :red_circle: include snow-cover melting cycles?). For each snow cover indicator we applied a trend analysis in the period analysed (2000-2014) at pixel scale. We applied Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen slope stimation in each of the pixels comprising Sierra Nevada (*n=7994* :red_circle:). The analysis of trends evaluates the intensity (adimensional), magnitude (expressed in days early or late), the sign (early or late) and the degree of statistical significance during the period analysed (14 years). Finally, the spatial pattern of these trends was explored according to elevation. 

### Results 
Snow cover has undergone significant changes in the last 14 years. 80 % of the pixels covering Sierra Nevada showed a negative trend in the duration of snow cover. We also observed a delay in the snow-cover onset date (68.03 % pixels showing a positive trend in the snow-cover onset date) and an advance in the melt date (80.72 % of pixels followed a negative trend for the snow-cover melting date)

The evaluation of the spatial pattern of snow cover duration showed that both the trend and the slope of the trend become more pronounced with elevation. In higher elevations the snow cover duration decreased an average of 3 days from 2000-2014.

## Some notes 
Some ideas:
* Show temporal trends of the snowpack dynamic in the last 14 years in Sierra Nevada
* Spatial analysis (elevation) of the dynamics 
* Relation with hydrological model 
* Ecosystem services? Ski resort? 


## Implications for managemet
* Importancia de conocer la dinamica nival y su relación con la estación de esquí?? 
* Es una primer contribución de una serie temporal corta --> Necesidad de analisis a mas largo plazo. 
* ¿Acoplamiento de ambos estudios (tendencias mediante MODIS y modelos hidrológicos)?
