## Mann-Kendall Seil Sen Slope Analysis 
This [script](./analysis/computeMK_all.md) computes Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimator for each variable. We computed the MKTS for different variables at different temporal scales. 

* For **snow-cover** related indicators (i.e.: scd; scod; scmd; scmc; all derived from MODIS) we used annual data. 
* For variables dervied from **WiMMed**, we used three temporal scales: annual, monthly and seasonal data.
